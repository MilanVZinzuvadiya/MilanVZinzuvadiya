# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am highly interested in crafting ingenious **Algorithms**. My Focus is to create flexible code like "swiss knife" which can address array of problems and can be modified with ease.

**Python** is my primary language to code. Apart from Python :snake: , I code in **C/C++** and :coffee:**JAVA**.

I am curious:thought_balloon: about **Data** and its tremdous use cases. Field of **Artificial Intelligence** amazes:open_mouth: me. Currently, I am doing **Research in Reinforcement Learning**- the paradigm of **Machine Learning**. Apart from this, I love solving puzzles and I am always ready to discuss mysteries of Universe :milky_way: from Big Bang to Black holes.
